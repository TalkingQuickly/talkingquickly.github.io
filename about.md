My name's Ben Dixon, I'm a CTO and developer with a passion for building difficult things. My current toolbox is mainly Elixir + Liveview with React Native for apps and Docker + Kubernetes keeping it all running behind the scenes.

I'm the co-founder and CTO of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.getsona.com?utm_source=benblogabout">Sona</a> where we're building the operating system for the worlds deskless workforce. We're backed by some amazing venture investors including Googles Gradient and Speedinvest and an incredible collection of angels.

If you only read one thing I've written, [I would suggest this](/2015/04/what-id-tell-myself-about-startups/).

I'm the author of <a href="https://leanpub.com/deploying_rails_applications"
target="_blank">Reliably Deploying Rails Applications</a> which covers how
to deploy medium sized Rails Applications in an easy, scalable fashion and <a href="/deploying_rails/" target="_blank">spoke at Railsconf 2014</a> on this topic. I spoke at <a href="/railsconf2015/">Railsconf 2015</a> on how Docker can be tightly integrated with Rails to do far more interesting things than just deployment and at at Railsconf 2017 on how to develop React Web and React Native applications which share a common codebase.

Previously I co-founded <a href="http://www.makeitwithcode.com/" target="_blank">Make It With Code</a>, a project to help none developers to learn to <a href="/2014/01/teaching-people-to-code/" target="_blank">create useful things with code</a> as well as Catapult, a staff marketplace (think Uber for staff) which focused on Retail and Hospitality staff across the UK and Germany.

Before that I was the back-end lead at Active In Time where among other things we made the Speedo Fit swimming App and explored ways to make fitness more fun using technology and machine learning (we were the first people to make a swim tracking app for the Apple Watch!).

Other projects include working as the software and embedded device developer behind the <a href="http://www.mousemet.com/" target="_blank">Mousemet Electronic Von Frey</a> and building tooling to help startups manage their teams more effectively.

I'm always interested in chatting to new people whether it's about startups, tech, travel or photography.
