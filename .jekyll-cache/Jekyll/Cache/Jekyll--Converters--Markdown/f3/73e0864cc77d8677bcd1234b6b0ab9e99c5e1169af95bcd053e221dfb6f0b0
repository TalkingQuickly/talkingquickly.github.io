<p>It’s mainly a tool for me to skim through and remind myself of what I’ve read as a way to jog my thinking. The summaries are a mixture of notes I wrote when reading them, reminders from Shortform summaries and what I remember. So they’ve been heavily filtered by my interpretation and what I was thinking about at the time I read them. They are almost certainly <em>not</em> accurate summaries of the books themselves!</p>
