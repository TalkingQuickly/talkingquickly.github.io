I"	<p>My nameâ€™s Ben Dixon, Iâ€™m co-founder and CTO of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.getsona.com?utm_source=benblogabout">Sona</a> where weâ€™re building the operating system for the worlds deskless workforce.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re backed by <a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/14/sona-a-frontline-workforce-management-platform-raises-27-5m-with-eyes-on-us-expansion/">some amazing venture investors</a> including Googles Gradient, Felicis, Nothzone and Speedinvest and an incredible collection of angels.</p>

<p>If you only read one thing Iâ€™ve written, <a href="/2015/04/what-id-tell-myself-about-startups/">I would suggest this</a>.</p>

<p>As well as being an experienced CTO Iâ€™m the author of <a href="https://leanpub.com/deploying_rails_applications" target="_blank">Reliably Deploying Rails Applications</a> which covers how
to deploy medium sized Rails Applications in an easy, scalable fashion and <a href="/deploying_rails/" target="_blank">spoke at Railsconf 2014</a> on this topic. I spoke at <a href="/railsconf2015/">Railsconf 2015</a> on how Docker can be tightly integrated with Rails to do far more interesting things than just deployment and at at Railsconf 2017 on how to develop React Web and React Native applications which share a common codebase.</p>

<p>Previously I co-founded Catapult (also venture backed), a staff marketplace (think Uber for staff) which focused on Retail and Hospitality staff across the UK and Germany as well as <a href="http://www.makeitwithcode.com/" target="_blank">Make It With Code</a>, a project to help none developers to learn to <a href="/2014/01/teaching-people-to-code/" target="_blank">create useful things with code</a>.</p>

<p>Other projects include working as the software and embedded device developer behind the Mousemet Electronic Von Frey and building tooling to help startups manage their teams more effectively.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m always interested in chatting to new people whether itâ€™s about startups, tech, travel or photography. You can find me on twitter as <a href="http://www.twitter.com/talkingquickly" target="_blank">@talkingquickly</a> , on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/talkingquickly/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, or by emailing <a href="mailto:ben@talkingquickly.co.uk">ben@talkingquickly.co.uk</a>.</p>
