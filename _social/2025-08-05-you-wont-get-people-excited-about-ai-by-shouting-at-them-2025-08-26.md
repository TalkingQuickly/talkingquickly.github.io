You won't get people excited about AI by shouting at them. Early adopters seize opportunities, cautious ones prevent whiplashâ€”both are valuable. The winners will be whoever guides people up the adoption curve most efficiently.

The AI revolution won't be won by those who shout the loudest, but by those who guide others most effectively up the adoption curve.

For many of us, AI represents a fundamental shift in the skills needed to earn a living. Entire companies and countries are grappling with the reality that success over the next decade will be heavily determined by AI mastery. That's genuinely unsettling.

The hostile dynamic where AI evangelists berate skeptics is counterproductive. Shouting at people never made them agree with you.

Different adoption rates are actually beneficial: early adopters seize opportunities, while cautious adopters prevent whiplash and preserve what's valuable from before. Both are essential for sustainable transformation.

The real competitive advantage goes to those who skillfully guide their teams through this transition, not those who force it.

AI is too transformative to waste time fighting about it. How are you helping your team navigate this shift?

Shouting at people about AI won't make them adopt it. We need both early adopters (who seize opportunities) and cautious ones (who prevent us shipping garbage). The real skill is guiding people up the adoption curve, not fighting about it.
