tldr; going forward, if I have feedback for anyone good or bad, no matter how minor, I'm going to Slack it to you in the form "Feedback; _something I think_". I won't be at all offended if you ignore it, it's just my opinion. I'd **REALLY** like it if you did the same to me. 

<!--more-->

As anyone who's read Radical Candor knows, the premise is simple and incredibly appealing. (If you've read it prepare for a cringe worthy level of over simplification).

When you have an opinion about how somebody you work with is doing something, you tell them.

Somebody says "erm" too much when presenting? Tell them. Somebody constantly talks over other team mates and drowns them out? Tell them. Someone keeps shutting down conversations that contradict them? Tell them. You get the idea.

The underlying premise is how awesome would a workplace be if every time somebody saw a way they think we could improve, they told us about it and we did the same for them (irrespective of seniority).

How many underlying frustrations born out of the same annoyances occurring over and over again would simply evaporate when everything was out in the open.

The problem is that like most simple sounding things, it's REALLY hard to do. The approaches in the book are great, but hard to implement.

I first read the book a few years ago, tried to put it into action, bought it for lots of other people and left a stack of copies in the office for people to pick up. But it's really hard to kick off that cultural thing.

Since then I've tried lots of schemes, processes and meeting structures to try and create a radical-candor-esque feedback culture, and non of it's really worked. 

The fact remains, I think if a company can operate like that, it's be a kind of secret weapon.

So not having any more innovative techy process ideas for how to do this, I'm going to try something really simple.

If I have feedback for anybody, on anything. As soon as it comes up, I'm going to Slack it to them. I'm actively inviting everybody in the company to do the same to me.

Those Slack messages will look like this:

"Feedback; hey Dave, in today's presentation I thought that the material you were presenting was really strong, but from where I was it looked like you lost confidence on slides 1-3 (the context ones) perhaps because you were concerned people would be bored since it was background, and so tried to speed through them. I think you lose authority by doing this. In future I'd suggest if you decide to include slides, don't second guess yourself, trust your original judgement and take your time presenting them".

Another one might be:

"Feedback; Hey Jane, in todays copy review, every time somebody questioned your wording, you responded along the lines of "OK I'll change that". It's great your listening to peoples feedback, and would encourage you to drill into why they're making the suggestions they are, but you're the copy writer, there's a good chance you know best. Today it felt like 100% of challenges led to you changing the copy to what somebody else suggested. This isn't meant to be writing by committee, I'd like to see you push back more and defend your position"

Or:

"Feedback; Hey Mark, in todays planning session you used terms like 'bad', 'shit', 'complex', 'nonsense', 'opaque', 'step backwards' pretty much interchangeably. I can't come up with any examples of where these terms were backed by evidence, and my interpretation was that they seemed to be synonyms for "not my idea" or "something I'm not familiar with". I'd much prefer we cut the hyperbole (e.g. "bad", "shit", "nonsense" be struck out completely) and that other terms be backed up by data, e.g. "complex" be backed up by an explanation of precisely what makes it complex and in comparison to what".

Or shorter:

"Feedback; Loved the suggestions today, would have liked to see a lot more focus on the customer conversations that led you to them, some of them, especially the screen filtering one felt a bit "nobody's asking for x but wouldn't it be cool if". Nothing wrong with that but would like to be clear which it is.

An important note here is that **Nobody** has any obligation to accept this feedback, it's totally valid to look at it and say "yeah, that's not valid feedback" and do nothing with it.

## Giving me feedback

I can't make anybody give me feedback like this, but I can't tell you how much I would appreciate it. I can make a firm promise that the reception will be nothing but positive, no matter how bad the feedback.

A big part of my motivation for this is the hope that if I kick this off, other people will start doing it back to me.

The vast majority of negative / improvement feedback I've received in my life to date has led me to say something along the lines of "ah man I wish someone had pointed this out sooner". 

Some examples of made up feedback I would genuinely be happy to receive (with a few real bits thrown in for fun):

- You talk to fast, I don't think anyone there could understand you, especially the non-native English speakers
- I don't understand why we're putting so much resource into this feature, it doesn't feel like we've researched this properly with customers but I think because it's perceived as your pet project, nobody wants to say anything
- We aren't getting clear timelines from product and we need those for managing client relationships, when people ask you for them your visibly defensive so nobody wants to but eventually we're going to lose a client over this
- That presentation was good, now do it all again without saying "erm"
- You're forcing through implementation details and the new people on the team don't want to challenge you but they actually have more experience with this bit of tech than you so I think you should listen to them
- It feels like you're using "show me data" as a tool to block things you disagree with, if you're going to do this you need to hold your own ideas to the same standards
- When I gave you feedback on X you seemed defensive and annoyed, I'm nervous of giving you feedback in future

On balance I'd say it's very rare I've ever received feedback and not thought there was something to learn and tweak there.

It's possible I won't make the exact change you ahd in mind, but what I can guarantee is that no matter what the feedback, I will be genuinely grateful for you giving it to me and the reception (and my resulting perception of you) will be nothing but positive.

## Etiquette

Some practicalities on this;

- I'm going to start giving feedback like this to everyone. If you'd prefer that I didn't just let me know, you can do this at any point
- I'd love a tick or thumbs up if you've read something, and will always be super keen to chat about things in more detail, but beyond an acknowledgement that you've read it, there's no need for longer responses
- All feedback given to anybody should be constructive. I don't think there's anyone in this company who doesn't know what constructive feedback is (although there are some AMAZING books below on how pretty much anyone can get better at it)
- I have a strong preference for async written communication, especially in a remote team. This is partly because I generally think I express myself better in writing and partly because of my engineers love of the large blocks of un-interrupted time async written allows me. That said if you prefer to either discuss feedback given via video call, give feedback or that I give all feedback via a call, that's completely fine, just let me know

The book "thanks for the feedback is great" (link at bottom) and if you don't have time to read it, there's also a summary which is well worth looking through as a refresher on how to give and receive feedback.
